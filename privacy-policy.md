**Last Updated:** 2026-01-12

PromptGuard ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use our browser extension (the "Service").

## 1. Data Collection

PromptGuard does **not collect, store, transmit, or sell personal data** from users. The extension operates entirely on your local device, and all processing of data occurs locally within your browser.

All text analysis by the extension occurs locally on your device and is used only to determine if the text you are about to submit contains sensitive information. Prompt text, chat messages, and/or website content are **never sent to any external servers or third parties**.

## 2. Data Usage

PromptGuard does **not** collect or retain:

- Personally identifiable information
- Authentication credentials
- Financial or payment information
- Personal communications
- Location data
- Browsing history
- Website content
- Keystrokes or user activity logs

Any analysis of txt is **ephemeral** and is discarded immediately after the check is performed.

## 3. Local Analytics (Non-identifying)

PromptGuard stores aggregated, non-identifying usage statistics locally in the browser to support an opt-in analytics feature. This data includes:

- Number of times the extension has been used
- Types of sensitive data detected (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers)
- The website domain where the warning occured

These analytics:

- Contain no prompt text or user content
- Never leave the user's device
- Are not shared with any third parties

## 4. Data Sharing

PromptGuard does **not** share any user data with third parties. Since no personal or prompt data is collected, there is nothing to share.

## 5. Permissions

PromptGuard requests access to website control solely to analyze user input for the purpose of detecting sensitive information before submission. This access is necessary for the extension to function as intended and does not involve data storage, tracking, or transmission.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

If PromptGuard's data practices change in the future, this privacy policy will be updated accordingly. We encourage users to review this policy periodically for any updates. Any material changes will be communicated through the extension's version update notes.
